# Inductance-Meter
Standalone Arduino Inductance (L) Meter designed to accurately measure inductance using the LC Tank Circuit Resonance Method. It pairs an unknown inductor with a known capacitor to find the resonant frequency, using an LM339 comparator for signal shaping and an Arduino Uno with an IÂ²C LCD for precise, stable, standalone measurements.
